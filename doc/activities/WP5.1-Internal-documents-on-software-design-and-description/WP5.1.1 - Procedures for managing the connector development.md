### Managing other partners development
1.  Every partner in WP5 checks if the [data model](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp3-data-model) is compatible with their own datamodel and where there are issues that may need to be resolved.
2. WP5 implements all the [stable API's](http://developers.erasmuswithoutpaper.eu/) (the ones with a green label) 
3. WP5 publishes their implementations online on [GitHub](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-reference-connector)
4. WP5 "sends" their manifest URLs to WP4. WP4 puts those into the DEV Registry Service.
5. WP5 tests each other's implementations of Echo API.
6. WP5 implements Institutions API v0.2.0.
