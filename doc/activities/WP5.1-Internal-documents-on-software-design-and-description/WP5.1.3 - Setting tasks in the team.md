## WP5.1.3 - Setting tasks in the team

The development team performs the actual work as problem solvers and designers. Normally the WP5-team consists of 5 people - a group size that experience and research are optimal for this type of work. How the work is arranged and how assignments are distributed is determined by the team members.

The team lacks solid project roles. This means that all the expertise needed to deliver the product should be in the team. Together, all of the development team responsible for the Sprint delivery. Offcourse this does not prevent that individual members normally are experts in a specific field of work.
